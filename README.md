Followed a code-along [tutorial by Paul Hudson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP-SQXTtWhY&t=2670s) to create a mock travel app as an introduction to Swift.

The App contains 3 Views:
- Discover: containing an image and text pertaining to a specific holiday destination
- Locations: A Swift MapKit view with flags displaying holiday destinations which act as links to Discover pages
- Tips: A set of accordion style tabs giving travel advice
